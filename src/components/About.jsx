            I began my journey in technology at a young age, driven by curiosity for how the
            digital world works. Through years of hands-on exploration, I've developed a strong
            foundation across both front-end and back-end development. My studies in Computer
            Science have sharpened my ability to design robust, efficient systems and stay up to
            date with emerging technologies.

            Inspired by the journey of Sundar Pichai, I aspire to lead at the highest levels of
            technology. I aim to drive innovation that positively impacts communities worldwide.
            Through continuous learning and building with cutting-edge tools, I'm working to become
            a transformative leader who shapes the future of technology with excellence and
            integrity.
